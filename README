List type variable
==================
The variable can be added as a list. a list can have duplicate values. 
length of list can be found by length function

length(var.listvariable-name)

resource "aws_security_group_rule" "frontend_sg_rule_https" {
  count = length(var.sg_ports)
  from_port         = var.sg_ports[count.index]
  to_port           = var.sg_ports[count.index]
  protocol          = "tcp"
  type              = "ingress"
  cidr_blocks       = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.frontend_sg.id
}

count.index starts at 0

For each loop , instead of count.

The array in for each should be a set. And the elements cannot be repeated. 

We cannot create a set variable. We can convert a list array to set using toset function. The variable should be encoded in quotes. 


resource "aws_security_group_rule" "frontend_sg_rule_https" {
  for_each          = toset(var.sg_ports)  >>> convert the list to set using toset
  from_port         = each.key
  to_port           = each.key
  protocol          = "tcp"
  type              = "ingress"
  cidr_blocks       = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.frontend_sg.id
}

sg_ports              = ["80", "443"]  >>> here the value should be added in quotes. 

When we use count, the result is stored in a list.
But whne we use for each, the results are stored as key value paires , where the key is sg rule id and value is the port number. 
So, even if we add new port in middle, thiswont effect the existing sg rules.
